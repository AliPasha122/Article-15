The widespread use of Wi-Fi devices exposes individuals to low-level electromagnetic
radiation, raising health concerns despite inconclusive evidence. This research proposes a
Dynamic Wi-Fi Power Management System that adjusts signal strength based on real-time
usage patterns. The system uses machine learning algorithms to predict device activity,
reducing unnecessary radiation without compromising network performance. This article
presents the design, functionality, potential impact, and limitations of the proposed solution.
